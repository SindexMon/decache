        <h1>Internet stuff is important.</h1>
        <span><i>And... you might have some of it.</i></span>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <span>When you visit a website, all the files it has to load in (like images, videos, games, etc.) are temporarily stored in what's called the <b>cache</b>. After a few days of use, as new files come in, these files are deleted to save space.</span>
        <br/><br/><span>Mostly.</span>
        <br/><br/><span>Time and time again, it's been proven that there are too many glitches to say that for sure. Many people have a treasure trove of old, sought-after internet stuff on their old computers - and they don't know it.</span>
        <br/><br/><span><i>Decache</i> will automatically find these files, scan them, and compare them against hundreds of pieces of <b>lost media</b>.</span>
        <br/><br/><h1>Why should I use it?</h1>
        <div class="subline"></div>
        <span>If a community effort is put behind this</span>
        <br/><br/><span>Not to mention how many of these videos have <b>cash bounties</b> for recovering them, most notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhwK57hBPmA"><i>penguinz0's</i></a>, who has $50 USD placed on each of his 100+ deleted videos.</span>
