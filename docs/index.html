        <h1>Internet stuff is important.</h1>
        <span><i>And... you might have some of it.</i></span>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>When you visit a website, all the files it has to load in (like images, videos, games, etc.) are temporarily stored in what's called the <b>cache</b>. After a few days of use, as new files come in, these files are deleted to save space.</p>
        <p>Mostly.</p>
        <p>Time and time again, it's been proven that there are too many glitches to say that for sure. Many people have a treasure trove of old, sought-after internet stuff on their old computers - and don't know it.</p>
        <p><i>Decache</i> will automatically find these files, scan them, and compare them against hundreds of pieces of <b>lost media</b>.</p>
        <h1>Why should I use it?</h1>
        <div class="subline"></div>
        <p>As more and more people check their computers, the odds of any of these bits of internet history being found <i>skyrocket</i>. The biggest video with a segment found using this strategy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZo9IkS1k7g"><i>Super Mario 64 big star secret</i></a>, was found by someone who didn't even <i>remember</i> watching it.</p>
        <p>Additionally, many of these videos have had <b>cash bounties</b> placed on them, most notably those by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhwK57hBPmA"><i>penguinz0</i></a>, who has offered <b>$50 USD</b> for each of his 100+ deleted videos.</p>
        <h1>How to use</h1>
        <div class="subline"></div>
        <p>Upon extracting the program and running <span>start_decache.bat</span>, it will ask for one thing: the path to your hard drive - a.k.a. the computer itself. If you're running <i>Decache</i> on the computer you intend to search, you can simply enter <span>C:</span>.</p>
        <p>If you're unsure about where a backup may be located, a default Windows installation will show a folder called <span>Users</span> or <span>Documents and Settings</span>, though user-specific backups (i.e. those with a <span>Desktop</span> folder) are also supported.</p>
